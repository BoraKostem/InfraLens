# Terraform Workspace Management

## Purpose

This document explains how AWS Lens manages Terraform workspaces for a tracked project, where workspace state is stored, and what safeguards apply when an operator creates, switches, or deletes a workspace.

It focuses on the current Electron implementation in this repository, not generic Terraform usage.

## What AWS Lens Treats As Workspace State

AWS Lens tracks workspace information in two places:

- Terraform-native files inside the project directory
- app-managed metadata under Electron `userData`

### Inside The Terraform Project

Terraform itself remains the source of truth for the active workspace and workspace-specific state layout.

AWS Lens reads or writes these project-local locations:

- `.terraform/environment`
  - current workspace name
- `terraform.tfstate`
  - default local-backend state file
- `terraform.tfstate.d/<workspace>/terraform.tfstate`
  - local backend workspace state files when Terraform creates them
- `.terraform-workspace.auto.tfvars.json`
  - app-managed inputs written before commands that need them
- `.terraform-workspace.tfplan`
- `.terraform-workspace.tfplan.meta.json`
- `.terraform-workspace.state.json`
  - cached result of state reads and pulls

### Inside Electron userData

AWS Lens persists project registration and workspace-related UI metadata in:

- `terraform-workspace-state.json`

That file stores data per AWS profile. For each tracked project it keeps:

- project ID
- project name
- root path
- selected input configuration
- persisted variable values
- environment metadata such as:
  - `workspaceName`
  - `environmentLabel`
  - `region`
  - `connectionLabel`
  - `backendType`
  - `varSetLabel`

This app-level file does not replace Terraform's own workspace state. It exists so the UI can restore project context quickly.

## How AWS Lens Detects Workspaces

When a project is loaded, AWS Lens first tries the Terraform CLI:

```text
terraform workspace show
terraform workspace list
```

If those commands succeed, the UI uses their output as the workspace snapshot.

If they fail, AWS Lens falls back to a filesystem-based snapshot:

1. read `.terraform/environment` for the current workspace
2. scan `terraform.tfstate.d/` for known workspace directories
3. always include `default`

That fallback lets the UI remain usable even when the CLI is unavailable, not initialized, or temporarily failing.

## Workspace Operations

All workspace mutations run in the Electron main process and invoke Terraform directly against the tracked project root.

### Select Workspace

AWS Lens runs:

```text
terraform workspace select <name>
```

After a successful switch, AWS Lens:

- clears the cached state snapshot
- refreshes the project detail
- updates the stored environment metadata in `terraform-workspace-state.json`

### Create Workspace

AWS Lens runs:

```text
terraform workspace new <name>
```

Terraform creates the workspace and switches into it. After success, AWS Lens clears cached state and reloads the project view.

### Delete Workspace

AWS Lens runs:

```text
terraform workspace delete <name>
```

Before it allows that action, AWS Lens enforces these rules:

- workspace name must be non-empty
- workspace name cannot contain whitespace
- `default` cannot be deleted
- the currently selected workspace cannot be deleted
- the UI requires typed confirmation for the chosen workspace name

Terraform remains the final authority. If the backend refuses deletion, AWS Lens surfaces the Terraform error instead of forcing the change.

## Backend And State Implications

Workspace handling affects where Terraform state lives and how AWS Lens labels backend details.

### Local Backend

For local state, AWS Lens treats:

- `terraform.tfstate` as the default workspace state file
- `terraform.tfstate.d/<workspace>/terraform.tfstate` as the non-default workspace location

When the app needs to display a current state snapshot, it resolves sources in this order:

1. `terraform.tfstate`
2. newest readable workspace state file under `terraform.tfstate.d/*/terraform.tfstate`
3. cached `terraform state pull` output
4. no state

### S3 Backend

For S3 backends, AWS Lens parses backend settings from Terraform files and computes the effective state key for the active workspace.

Behavior:

- `default` uses the configured backend `key`
- non-default workspaces use:

```text
<workspace_key_prefix>/<workspace>/<key>
```

If `workspace_key_prefix` is not set, AWS Lens assumes Terraform's common default of `env:`.

That computed path is used in backend labels shown in the UI so operators can tell which remote state object is active for the selected workspace.

## Inputs And Workspace Changes

Workspace selection is separate from variable-set selection, but AWS Lens keeps both in the project environment summary.

Commands such as `plan`, `apply`, `destroy`, `import`, and selected state commands can cause AWS Lens to write runtime input files before invoking Terraform. That means:

- switching workspaces changes the Terraform state target
- selected variable sets still control the input values passed into Terraform
- the two concepts are related in the UI but stored independently

AWS Lens does not automatically map a workspace name to a variable overlay. Operators can use matching names if they want that convention, but it is not enforced by the app.

## UI Safeguards

The Terraform console exposes workspace controls directly in the project view:

- a selector for the current workspace
- a `Create Workspace` action
- a `Delete Workspace` action

Current safeguards in the renderer:

- delete options only list non-current, non-`default` workspaces
- create trims surrounding whitespace before submission
- delete requires the operator to type the exact workspace name
- running Terraform commands disable workspace-changing controls

The main process repeats the critical safety checks, so the protection does not rely only on the renderer.

## Operational Guidance

- Use `default` for the baseline state only if the Terraform project is intentionally designed that way.
- Prefer explicit workspace names such as `dev`, `staging`, or `prod` instead of overloading one workspace with variable-file changes.
- Do not treat `terraform-workspace-state.json` as canonical infrastructure state; it is UI persistence only.
- If workspace detection looks wrong, inspect `.terraform/environment` and `terraform.tfstate.d/` first.
- If a delete fails, assume the backend or Terraform CLI is protecting state and resolve that in Terraform rather than editing app files manually.
- After a workspace switch, re-check the backend label and current state source before destructive operations.
